    The major components of Flow are as below:
     1. Flow Builder -> Speaker    -> emit data
     2. Operator     -> Translator ->  Transforming the data from one format to another.
     3. Collector    -> Listener   ->  Collects the items emitted using the Flow Builder which are transformed by the operators.
